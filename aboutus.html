                <p>It is no secret that food insecurity can happen to just about anyone; all it takes is a loss of a job or a significant illness and decisions like paying bills or eating three meals a day become daily life stressors? In addition to the monthly food drive, the Community Warriors have taken the lead in:
                        Assisting during natural and un-natural disasters. For example, the Red Cross emergency operations: natural disaster relief we assist in setting up shelters.  During an un-natural disaster such as apartment fire etc., we ensure clothing and furniture are given to those impacted (in some cases losing all their possessions) as we store donated furniture and clothing for such disasters.
                        Assisting disabled or elderly people in need who cannot afford to have someone come in and mow the lawn or remove tree limbs and debris (done on a monthly basis).
                        Assisting (during Covid pandemic 2020/2021) Columbus 911 dispatchers with non-life threatening emergencies—Lift and Assist program. 
                </p>
                
                <p>The Community Warriors rely on volunteers and members who come out every month during the mobile food drive and give of their time in service of the community.  The greatest gift we can give to anyone is time. Because when you give your time, you are giving a portion of your life that you will never get back. 
                    In order to sustain the organization and do the work we do, we depend on donations from altruistic benefactors. We are asking your organization, Pratt and Whitney for a donation to assist with the food drives (providing lunches for the volunteers and assisting with repairs and on-going maintenance of the box truck) and other missions we are undertaking in service of the community. The box truck allows The Community Warriors the ability to go directly into “at risk” neighborhoods and distribute food to disabled veterans and non-veterans who are “sick” and shut in and are unable to participate in the monthly mobile food drive.
                    The Community Warriors believe that one should never forget to give. Give of yourself, your time, your love and donate to worthy causes.  So many lives can be changed by our kindness and goodness.
                </p>
                        
                
                <p>To assist in combatting hunger and food insecurity within our community, one of the projects we do every month is the mobile food drive on the third and fourth Saturday. Four years ago The Community Warriors “partnered” with Feeding the Valley Food Bank for a monthly food drive—and that partnership paved the way for us to manage one of the largest mobile food drives within the states of Georgia and Alabama.  Every month four semi-trucks distribute food  (Columbus Civic Center 3rd Saturday and Phenix City Activity Center 4th Saturday) to the community. </p>
