                <h3>Our Sole Mission is to serve Our Community</h3>
                <p>The Community Warriors is a non-profit 501 c-3 organization founded in 2018 by Hai Clay (the president of the organization) and a several Veterans who served our great nation; but wanted to continue to serve-- with a new mission to serve the community—being our brothers and sisters keepers. The creed we live by is: See a need take the lead. </p>

                <div class="main">
                    <p>It is no secret that food insecurity can happen to just about anyone; all it takes is a loss of a job or a significant illness and decisions like paying bills or eating three meals a day become daily life stressors? The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food insecurity “as a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active healthy life.” Food insecurity indicates not having enough food to eat (quantity), as well as not having enough healthy food to eat (quality) Food-insecure children and teenagers have been shown to miss school more frequently, and are more likely to repeat a grade than food-secure children. According to the USDA, twelve percent of Georgia households with children do not have the resources to provide enough food for an active, healthy lifestyle for all family members. Research shows that consistent lack of food can have serious negative short-term and long-term impacts on a child’s wellbeing. Children without enough to eat tend to be sick more often, recover from illness more slowly and are hospitalized more frequently. They can also experience lifelong consequences including developmental delays, poor educational outcomes and mental health disorders. Food insecurity has shown to reduce a child's chances of graduating from high school. It is clear, that growing up food-insecure has consequences even beyond K-12 education. </p>

                    <p>To assist in combatting hunger and food insecurity within our community, one of the projects we do every month is the mobile food drive on the third and fourth Saturday. Four years ago The Community Warriors “partnered” with Feeding the Valley Food Bank for a monthly food drive—and that partnership paved the way for us to manage one of the largest mobile food drives within the states of Georgia and Alabama.  Every month four semi-trucks distribute food  (Columbus Civic Center 3rd Saturday and Phenix City Activity Center 4th Saturday) to the community. </p>

                    <p>The Community Warriors rely on volunteers and members who come out every month during the mobile food drive and give of their time in service of the community.  The greatest gift we can give to anyone is time. Because when you give your time, you are giving a portion of your life that you will never get back. </p>
